# DCGAN
Repository for a Data Science Project where I developed DCGANs trained on MNIST and CIFAR-10.

In this folder you will find several files:

DCGAN_PROJECT.pdf
    This is a paper that I wrote with two of my fellow students: Xi Chen and Dongni Xie. 
    The paper does a much better job of explaining the math behind the project than I will in this file.
    The Sections I,II,III and IV.A were written by me, and the rest was written by my co-authors.
    I suggest at least glancing over the paper as it puts the entire project into perspective.
    
dcgan_MNIST.ipynb/dcgan_CIFAR10.ipynb
    These are Jupyter Notebooks with the DCGAN code. Since the code was written in Google
    Colab, I recommend opening them in Colab if you choose to download, because some of the
    code is specifically designed to navigate Colab.
 
reverse_generator.ipynb
    This is code I wrote to create a Neural Net that takes a CIFAR-10 image and converts
    it to a 100x1 vector in the latent space of an already-trained DCGAN Neural Net. This
    NN exists to investigate a potential new cost function for DCGANs (outlined in the project pdf)
 
images_1/images_2/images_3/images_4
    A collection of images randomly generated by the DCGAN mixed with real images from CIFAR-10.
    We wanted to see if our DCGAN could trick human investigators, so we made a little game with these
    images to see who we could fool.
